Use Case 2: Update a product

For example, assume we want to change the price of apples from $1.00 to $0.50

First, we open the store app (see usecase1_a.png)

Next, we click on the "UPDATE EXISTING PRODUCT" button (usecase1_a.png)

Next, we are taken to a page displaying existing items. we find the item we want to update, and select the "Update" button (usecase2_a.png)

Next, we are taken to a page with the existing information for the product already filled in (usecase2_b.png)

Now we will change the price for apples from $1.00 to $0.50 (usecase2_c.png) and click "submit" at the bottom of the page

Finally, we are taken to an updated version of the database where the changed information is visible (usecase2_d.png)
